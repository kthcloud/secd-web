        <h5>Abstract</h5>
        <p>
            In the shifting sand that is machine learning research, there is an ongoing balancing act between keeping
            sensitive data and optimizing workflow. As the AI gold rush is in full force, the demand for secure and
            efficient workflows has been steadily increasing. Today, workflows are often based on either too restrictive
            practices that worsen the quality of research, e.g. complicated policies designed for large corporations
            with
            dedicated teams, or forgo the security aspect altogether, breaking regulations and the trust of data owners.
            This paper addresses ways to conduct machine learning training on real medical records in a safe
            environment.
            The result of the project is a prototype implementation of a secure workflow with a custom code runner which
            facilitates machine learning projects that use sensitive data while ensuring secure data storage. Field
            expert
            interviews provided insights into the workflow's effectiveness, highlighting the trade-offs between security
            and
            usability, and the need for future enhancements to address potential data leakage issues.</p>
